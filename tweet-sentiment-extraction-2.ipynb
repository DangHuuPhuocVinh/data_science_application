    "# TensorFlow roBERTa Starter - LB 0.705\n",
    "This notebook is a TensorFlow template for solving Kaggle's Tweet Sentiment Extraction competition as a question and answer roBERTa formulation. In this notebook, we show how to tokenize the data, create question answer targets, and how to build a custom question answer head for roBERTa in TensorFlow. Note that HuggingFace transformers don't have a `TFRobertaForQuestionAnswering` so we must make our own from `TFRobertaModel`. This notebook can achieve LB 0.715 with some modifications. Have fun experimenting!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run this code offline and it will save the best model weights during each of the 5 folds of training. Upload those weights to a private Kaggle dataset and attach to this notebook. Then you can run this notebook with the line `model.fit()` commented out, and this notebook will instead load your offline models. It will use your offline models to predict oof and predict test. Hence this notebook can easily be converted to an inference notebook. An inference notebook is advantageous because it will only take 10 minutes to commit and submit instead of 2 hours. Better to train 2 hours offline separately."
